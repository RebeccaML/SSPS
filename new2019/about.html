            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>
                A teacher’s job is to educate and provide a loving, safe, and comfortable learning environment. Every
                child/family that comes through my doors will be treated with love and respect.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am committed to providing your child with quality care in a structured but fun learning atmosphere
                based on curriculum from the Washington State Early Learning and Developmental Guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know how important it is for children to be prepared for Kindergarten. By using hands on
                developmentally appropriate practices, my goal is to get your child ready for the next step in their
                education.
            </p>

            <h2>Schedule</h2>
            <p>
                Children need a simple routine to follow. This helps them learn and anticipate what comes next.
                This is subject to change from day to day depending on what we are learning about and of course the
                weather.</p>
