            <h2>About the Teacher</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Shannon McComb. I am the director and teacher at Shining Stars Preschool.

                Teaching has always been a dream of mine. My mom was a teacher and ever since I was 5 I have wanted to
                be a teacher like her.
                I helped my mom in her kindergarten classroom for many years and now it is time to fulfill my passion of
                teaching children by turning it into a career.
                I started my education in teaching in Colorado at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs.
                I am currently taking classes at WGU to finish my degree in Elementary Education.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have always been engaged with children through church, Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts, and have been a
                volunteer at my children's schools for the past 6 years.
                I am excited to open a school out of my home.
                My basement has been turned into a colorful and fun learning environment for preschool-aged students and
                I am eager for this new adventure and chapter in my life to begin.
