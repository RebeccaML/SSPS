				<p>
					My name is Shannon McComb.  I am the director and teacher at Shining Stars Preschool.
				</p>
				<p>
					Teaching has always been a dream of mine.  My mom was a teacher and ever since I was 5 I have wanted to be a teacher like her.
					I helped my mom in her kindergarten classroom for many years and now it is time to fulfill my passion of teaching children by turning it into a career.
					I started my education in teaching in Colorado at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs.
					I am currently taking classes at WGU to finish my degree in Elementary Education.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have always been engaged with children through church, Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts, and have been a volunteer at my children's schools for the past 6 years.
					I am excited to open a school out of my home.
					My basement has been turned into a colorful and fun learning environment for preschool-aged students and I am eager for this new adventure and chapter in my life to begin.
